## Module 2: File Operations and Navigation
### Task 3 : File Manipulation
- Created, moved, copied, and deleted files and directories.
- Used wildcards (`*`, `?`) for efficient file operations.
- Showcased the use of `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` commands.


#### In the following screenshot it is demonstrated how I have :
 - Created a new text file
 - Created a new directory
 - Moved the new created file into the new created directory
 - Copied the new created file into another file
 - Copied a file into the new directory
 - I have used the ls command to list the directory files and the more command to show the text file content
 - All can be seen in the following [Screenshots](Screenshots/Commands.png)
