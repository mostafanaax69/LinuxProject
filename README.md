## Module 1: Ubuntu Setup and Basic Command

### Task 1:  Ubuntu Installation
- Installed the latest LTS version of Ubuntu on a virtual machine USING a software called Parraler whichi is a virtual machines host software for MAC.

### Task 2: Terminal Basics
- Familiarized myself with the Ubuntu Terminal.
- Executed basic commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and 10 additional commands of my choice : [Can be found in this Folder](Module1/task2.md)

## Module 2: File Operations and Navigation



## Module 3: User Management and Permissions

### Task 5: User Accounts
- Created a new user account and set a password.
- Switched between users using `su` and `sudo`.
- Provided screenshots of user creation and switching.

### Task 6: File Permissions
- Understood and modified file permissions using `chmod`.
- Explored the concepts of user, group, and others.

## Module 7: Final Exercise

### Exercise: Report System Health Check and Performance Monitoring Bash Script
- Checked essential services (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and MySQL database services) and reported their status.
- Monitored disk usage, identified partitions with usage over a set threshold (e.g., 80%).
- Checked for read-only file systems.
- Monitored CPU and memory usage for each running process, flagged values exceeding normal operating parameters.
- Analyzed system logs for signs of errors or warnings.
- Listed all current user failed SSH login sessions and checked for any unauthorized access attempts.
- Scanned for open ports and reported any unexpected open ports.
- Formatted the output in a clear, readable manner.
- Included timestamped logs of each health check.
- Optionally, emailed the report to a specified system administrator.
- Implemented robust error handling within the script.
- Logged each action performed by the script for later analysis.
- Ensured the script runs efficiently with minimal system impact.
- Optimized the script to run periodically (e.g., as a cron job) or on-demand.

## Submission

### Task 13: Project Documentation
- Created a GitHub repository for the assignment.
- Submitted a comprehensive README.md documenting each task.
- Included a summary of challenges faced and lessons learned.
