## Module 1: Ubuntu Setup and Basic Command
### Basic Commands
- Familiarized myself with the Ubuntu Terminal.
- Executed basic commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and 10 additional commands of my choice for Example :
  - LS : Lists directory contents of files and directories.
  - CD : " Change Dirctory " : changes the current dirctory into another one , EX : CD ./Home/folder1 ( changes the dirctory to there) cd ~ : ~ this argument is used in cd command to change the directory to the home directory from any location in Linux System. 
  - pwd : Checks the current location path or we can say the current directory name
  - mkdir : Creates a new directory touch : It is used to create a file without any content or to change and modify the timestamps of a file.
  - cat : Reads data from the file and gives its content as output ( can be used to create files also ex : cat hello > mostafa.txt )
  - cp : This command is used to copy files or groups of files or directories ( cp file1.txt file2.txt , now file 2 has contents of file 1).
  - echo : allows users to display lines of text or strings that are passed as arguments (echo "Hello There" ).
  - clear : is used to clear the terminal screen.
  - whoami : It displays the username of the current user when this command is invoked.
  - rm : used to remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links ( rm file1.txt would delete that file ).
  - mv : 1) Renaming a file or directory , 2) Moving a file or directory to another location.
  - grep : filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern.
  - ps : viewing information related with the processes on a system which stands as abbreviation for “Process Status”. ps command is used to list the currently running processes and their PIDs along with some other information depends on different options.
  - vim: an advanced and highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing.
